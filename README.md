### Benoit TORTEVOIS --- 05/2022 ###

Worked only in javascript for this project. On front-end.
Edited 5 scripts to:
- Display products dynamically on homepage
- Display one product on product page, let choose color and quantity, and add to cart
- Display cart summary, with possiblity to modify quantity or delete each product. Total quantity and price displayed in real-time
- Form with checked inputs (via regex). Sumbit button, that makes one final check before sending data to API.
- Confirmation page displays the order id returned by API.
